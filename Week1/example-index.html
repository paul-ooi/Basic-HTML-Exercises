<!-- HEADINGS, THINK ABOUT THESE LIKE HEADINGS IN AN ESSAY. ONLY HAVE ONE H1 TAG ON A PAGE, AND GO IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER. ITS BAD PRACTICE TO HAVE THESE APPEAR OUT OF ORDER. -->
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

<!-- THE TEXT BELOW, IF IT WEREN'T WRAPPED IN THE P TAGS, THEY WOULD APPEAR ON THE SAME LINE IN THE BROWSER. -->
<p>Hello World</p>
