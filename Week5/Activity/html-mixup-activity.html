            <h4>Background on CSS3</h4>

            </p>So CSS3 was a unique one-off opportunity. Rather than one big spec, break them into parts and start them all off at "Level 3" but then let them evolve separately. That was very <em>on purpose, so things could move quicker independently. </p></em>

            <paragraph>The problem? It was almost <span class="emphasis">too</span> effective. CSS3, and perhaps to a larger degree, "HTML5", became (almost) household names. <strong>It was so successful, it's leaving us wanting to pull that lever again.</strong> It was successful on a ton of levels:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It pushed browser technology forward, particularly on technologies that had been stale for too long.
                <li>It got site owners to think, "<em>hey maybe it's a good time to update our website.</em>"</li>
                It got educators to think, "<em>hey maybe it's a good time to update our curriculums."</li></em>
            </ol>

            <p>It was good for the web overall, good for websites taking advantage of it, and there was money to be made along the way. I bet it would be <em>staggering</em> to see how much money was made in courses and conferences waving the CSS3 flag.</span>
