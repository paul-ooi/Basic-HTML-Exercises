# Photoshop Layout

1. Create new file, make it simple and use a Web template (Desktop HD 1440px Width, at least 1024px Height, it'll grow later), 72 dpi
2. Make sure your rulers are set to pixels; Show the Rulers (Ctrl/Cmd + R), Right click on the rulers and select pixels
3. Setup a Grid; Go to View > New Guide Layout...
   1. Columns = 12 (no Rows for now)
   2. Gutters = 15px
   3. Center Columns, selected/checked
   4. Margins: Top = 0px, Left = 120px, Bottom = 0px, Right = 120px
   5. Click OK
   6. Remove the Top and Bottom Guide; Use the Move tool, to click and drag the Top and Bottom Guides off the document
4. You now have a file that can be used as a starting point for your Desktop version of your website, where you have content contained to the 1200px in the middle and allow for other elements like Header and footer, or feature images to span the full 1440px width.
