## Purpose

  - **User Experience #2**: Using a Screen Reader (see below under Resources) and Keyboard only (Cover one eye and use only one hand)
  - **User Experience #3**: Using a Screen Reader (see below under Resources) and Keyboard only (Blindfolded or with both your eyes closed)
- Open your browser.
- Begin your selected User Experience.
